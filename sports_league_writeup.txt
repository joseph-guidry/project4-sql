Project Name: Sports League

Project Goals:
	<A two to three sentence description of the project and its intent>
	In this project, SQL files are used to build a database of tables based on a particular sport. From these tables, certain
	data was to be queried with the result combining information from multiple tables. With the help of the different commands
	and functions from the lecture, the project is used to accomplish the steps required.

Considerations:
	<A bulleted list of considerations and conditions which affected the design of your project>
	- Correctly build tables based on criteria needed for future queries.
	- Use constraints to ensure proper construction of tables.
	- Proper use of syntax for queries in retrieving the required data on each step.

Initial Design:
	<A paragraph or more that adequately describes your program's structure and layout discussing the various modules (.c and corresponding .h files) that you implemented>
	During the making of this program, each SQL command is a step from the project documenations. As stated previously, the 
	first five steps have the student build the tables, as described below in the Entity Relationship Diagram(ERD).  Once 
	established, Step 6 asks to format input for each table, which will be used for the queries on the rest of the steps.
	Once the data has been entered into the tables, each of the remaining steps query the data for specific answers.
	Through the use of keywords learned in the lecture, queries resulted in providing the resquest information.
	This project required the construction of tables with data in steps. 
	
Data Flow:
	<A paragraph or longer describing the data flow of the program in a sequential manner.  Include a diagram when necessary.>
	The program flowed through the following steps.
	
	Steps 1 - 5: This is the table creation steps.
		Step 1 - Create teams table.
		Step 2 - Create players table.
		Step 3 - Create player info table.
		Step 4 - Create games table.
		Step 5 - Create game info table.

	Step 6: Fill the tables with data that will be used to fulfill the queries on the remaining steps.
			These values are hard-coded into the INSERT statements to provide readability on the data being added.
	
	Step 7 - 23: Select queries for specific information about the data inserted on Step 6.

	
	Based on this table construction on Steps 1 - 5, the required queries can be made.
	This ERD was altered from the Github page.

Communication Protocol:
	<Discuss any custom communication protocol you have used including the various request and responses that may be sent and received.>
	
	The project used MySQL to handle the use of SQL commands.

Potential Pitfalls:
	<Discuss any potential issues that you might run into while creating the project>
	- Improper data input on Step 6. This could lead to disaster if there isn't a proper plan for the data needed.
	- The proper syntax for sub-queries and SQL functions.
	- Getting the intended output from SELECT statements.
	- Poor relationship constraints during table creation.
	
Test Plan:
	User Test:
 		<Describe the steps taken for each user test.>
		- Attempt the simpler single answer queries first.
		- Simple sub-queries.
		- Use unions and joins to help gather pieces of data into a single temporary table.
		- Use view to save a sub-query that can be referenced in a later query, which helps with readability. 
	Test Cases:
		<A brief overview of the test cases that you implemented.>
		- Trial and Error. 

Conclusion:
	<A review of the project, what worked, what didnâ€™t and how to improve upon your project in the future.>

	The SQL project attempted to solidify a new layer of knowledge about software development that was new
	to me prior to this week.  The use of queries and building databases was exciting to learn, though the benefits on 
	the differences between how a query is structured and what makes a query better than another would have been helpful.
	The overall benefit from this project helped in achieve a baseline understanding of the SQL world of software development.
